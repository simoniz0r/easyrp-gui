# easyrp-gui

A GUI for controlling [EasyRP](https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP) for Discord RPC.

# Usage

**Dependencies**: curl (used for downloading EasyRP on first run), yad.

Before using `easyrp-gui`, you must have a Client ID for a Discord RPC application.  If you do not already have an application setup, create one [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).

After setting up your RPC application, just run `easyrp-gui`, fill out the required fields, and click `Save and Start`.  To stop `easyrp-gui`, run `easyrp-gui` again, and click `Stop and Exit`.

On first run, `~/.local/share/easyrp-gui` will be created, and EasyRP will be downloaded to `~/.local/share/easyrp-gui`.
